# NLP pipeline implementing numerous model architectures for phishing email detection  

## An end-to-end pipeline using FNN, LSTM-RNN, and transformer based networks trained for phishing email detection onvolving data processing, model trainings, EDA and manual testing.

I created this project to clean up the notebooks I had roughly created while writing my extended essay in the midst of the IBDP program. The research focus of my extended essay was to compare the efficiency of feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks with LSTM and transformer based networks for phishing email detection.
